## API for Finding Data About Airports Across the World Stored in a PostgreSQL Database.
#### Description: 

This API searches a database containing airport data and can be used to perform three different
types of queries: find_All, find_One, and find_Closest. find_All shows every airport and its data to
the user. find_One finds a airport that meets the given specifications defined by the user. This can be
the name of a country, city and more. The route will show the
user the first airport that meets the user's specifications. find_Closest takes a given set of 
latitude and longitude lines and will display the airport closest to the given coordinates. 

#### Instruction:

To run this program type: <u>python main.py</u> into your terminal and then go to <u>localhost:8080</u>
to view the API server and query the airport data.
